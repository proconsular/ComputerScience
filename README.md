# ComputerScience
A collection of data structures, algorithms, and other CS related items.

My first goal is to establish the fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, binary search trees and hash tables. After which I plan to add more advanced structures.

Once the basics are taken care of, I plan to add advanced structures and continuously progress into more and more sophiscated structures and possibly even modify or optimize them in different ways.
